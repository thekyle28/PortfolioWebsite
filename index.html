        <p class="mainContentText"> I'm Kyle Allen-Taylor, a second year Computer Science student, studying at the University of Birmingham.
            I am a calm, friendly, capable, and motivated person.
            I am a well rounded person who is generally good at everything and a quick learner.
            I am able to adapt to different situations and scenarios whilst also delivering everything I do to the best of my ability.
            As shown by my years so far at University and my academic performance at my A levels, GCSEs and (hopefully) my final degree classification, hard work pays off.
            I am driven by success and ensuring that jobs are done in a quick and efficient manner, whilst also being complete to a high standard.
            Everything that I experience I take as a learning experience and move on from my previous mistakes.
            My current career objective is to gain more experience with the technical side of working environments.
            The Technology Industry never ceases to amaze me, and in the future I yearn to be at the forefront of where
            the industry goes next alongside the other industry leaders.</p>

            <p class="mainContentText">
                For <a href="https://www.brumhack.co.uk/">BrumHack</a>  3.0 myself, Tom Clarke, Sebastian Dica, and Cameron Angus created an application that utilised
                <a href="http://www.clarifai.com/">Clarifai's</a> API, which returned words associated with a picture and probabilities for how accurate each one was.
                For example if a picture of a dog was sent to
                the API then Clarifai would return words such as, dog, animal, fur, eyes, tongue etc. with dog and animal having the highest probabilities.
                We utilised the words
                returned from a picture that the user submitted and searched on Wikipedia for articles related to those words.
                We would then display an interactive visualisation of all of the Wikipedia articles received from the picture
                using D3. An image of the application in action can be seen, this was the result of searching with a picture
                of the clock tower in the University of Birmingham, Old Joe. Elucidate cannot be used currently because the API
                for Clarifai is limited to use within the Hackathon. <br>

                My role during the Hackathon was to link the Clarifai API to Elucidate to allow us to return words for
                photos. This proved to actually be a lot more difficult than one would have thought and it involved creating
                a Java Maven project from scratch and using a local host on my PC. With assistance from the Clarifai
                representative we managed to eventually get the API working. Finally as we brought each of the tasks that we were
                working on together, we created a website for the application and I assisted with this by pair programming to
                work on the HTML, CSS and JavaScript of the website. This was one of my stand-out Hackathons for being
                so productive, whilst also having a lot of fun.

        <p class="mainContentText">For my A-Level project I developed a program that would be used in order to
            calculate the house points for Sports Day at Royal Russell School. I developed the program with Visual
            Basic, and worked on the project for the majority of year 13. The program allowed the user to enter the results
            from each event for Sports Day, it would then automatically calculate the house points for each section of Sports Day;
            the junior, intermediate and senior school tournaments. Once all of the points were entered by the user, the
            overall results for Sports Day could be viewed in tables and sorted by the winning houses.
            The data could be saved to the user's computer, so that they could enter the results in parts since, in
            total there were
            Results could also be viewed for each of the events, so that the participants results could be viewed,
            their position in the event and their house. You may view my coursework

            please note that the coursework is 550 pages and hence may take a while to load! The final version of the
            project's documentation can be found on pages 510-534.

            <img src="">
            <p class="mainContentText">For <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/about">Global Games Jam (GGJ) 2016</a>,
                myself, Hung Hoang, Vince Hoang and Barbra Ferreira
                created a story driven puzzle game. GGJ is a 48 hour event where you create games and the theme for GGJ
                this year was ritual. The main premise of the game was that
                you played as Tristan who has been banished to limbo and cursed with immortality. Tristan wants to die,
                and he has tried many different ways, however he can only kill himself by performing a ritual. In order
                to perform this ritual Tristan must kill 3 demons. As you play through the game you find out that these
                demons are in fact related to Tristan some way; you'll have to play the game to find out why.

                In order to complete Curse of Life we split the team evenly, with Vince and Barbra focusing on the Art,
                Sound and Design of the game, whilst Hung and I focused on the programming. I programmed the
                minimap, the dialogue boxes including all of the dialogue for the game and the heart beat and death logic
                for Tristan.

                I learnt a lot from this event which included a lot of coding in Unity, and it was the first time I had
                developed a game with a team of people, which proved to be very effective.
